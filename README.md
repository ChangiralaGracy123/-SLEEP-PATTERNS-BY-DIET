**Greg Martin Data Analysis in R**
This repository contains the R code, R Markdown file, and Word document submission for the Greg Martin data analysis project. The project involves summarizing and describing a dataset, reproducing the analysis in RStudio, and providing a detailed report with code, comments, and outputs.

**Project Description**

The project aims to:
- Analyze a dataset from Greg Martin.
- Reproduce the analysis in RStudio using R code.
- Save the analysis as an R Markdown (.Rmd) file and its output in a Word document.
- Provide a detailed report with the following:
      - Blocks of R code.
      - Comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each block.
      - Screenshots of the outputs (e.g., tables, plots) generated by the code.

**Project Structure**
- R-Markdown-template.Rmd: Customized R Markdown template for the project.
- ProjectAnalysis.Rmd: The R Markdown file containing the full analysis and code.
- ProjectAnalysis.docx: The Word document generated from the R Markdown file.
- Screenshots/: Folder containing screenshots of outputs generated during the analysis.
- README.md: This file.

**Instructions**
1. Reproduce the Analysis:
- Open the ProjectAnalysis.Rmd file in RStudio.
- Install the required R packages mentioned in the Dependencies section.
- Run the R Markdown file to execute the analysis.

2. Submission Requirements:
- The Word document (ProjectAnalysis.docx) includes:
  - R code blocks.
  - Comments for each block explaining its purpose.
  - Screenshots of outputs (data tables, plots, etc.).
**Dependencies**
To run the code, the following R packages are required:
- tidyverse
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- knitr
- rmarkdown
**Install these packages by running:**
" install.packages(c("tidyverse", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "knitr", "rmarkdown")) "
**Usage**
Example: Running the R Markdown File
1. Open RStudio and load the ProjectAnalysis.Rmd file.
2. Click "Knit" to generate the Word document.
3. Review the output in the ProjectAnalysis.docx file.
**Project Highlights**
1. Data Summarization: Descriptive statistics and insights.
2. Code Comments: Clear explanations for each block of code.
3. Visualization: Graphs and tables summarizing key data points.
4. Error Handling: Adjustments for R statements that may not run in R Markdown chunks.
